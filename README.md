# ðŸŽ¨ [Color Game](https://martini024.github.io/color-game-react/) (React Version)

This is a **React-based recreation** of the classic Color Game originally built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project was developed as a way to **practice React fundamentals** like component structure, props, state management, and event handling.

The idea is based on a tutorial found initially on YouTube, but this version is entirely rewritten in React to reinforce learning.

## ðŸ“š Purpose

This project was created to:

- Reinforce concepts learned while studying React
- Practice converting vanilla JS projects into component-based React apps
- Understand React state, props, and rendering logic
